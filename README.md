# AstroBounce - Jump Through Space!
Hack WashU 2023 - Emerging - Interactive Media

AstroBounce is a space-themed web game built using React Native Web and Expo and hosted on Firebase. I was inspired by the game Doodle Jump, but instead of an alien with a jetpack, you play with various planets in the solar system. Users have the option to select  which planet they want to play with.

During gameplay, you use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the planet across the screen and jump up from platform to platform. Gameplay is infinite and lasts as long as the user would like. The game ends when you miss the platforms and fall to the bottom of the screen.
